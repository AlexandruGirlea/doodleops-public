# DoodleOps FAQ

_Last updated: 27 July 2025_

Below are the questions we hear most often about licensing, pricing, support, and
contributing.  If you need more detail, open an issue or email
**alex@doodleops.com**.

## üìú Licensing

### **Q1. Is DoodleOps ‚Äúopen source‚Äù?**  
No.  The code is **source-available** under the Business Source License 1.1
(BSL). You can read, fork, and evaluate it for free, but **production use
requires a commercial licence** unless you qualify as a recognised NGO or you
are a hobbyist deploying it for non-commercial purposes (‚â§ 25 users).

### **Q2. What is the ‚ÄúChange Date‚Äù and Change License?**  
Every tagged release carries a Change Date four (4) years ahead.  When that date
arrives, that specific release automatically flips from BSL to the
**GNU General Public License, version 2.0 or later (GPL-2.0-or-later)**. 
Newer releases remain under BSL until their own Change Date.

### **Q3. Can my non-profit use DoodleOps in production for free?**  
Yes. Registered NGOs, research institutes, and charities may run DoodleOps in
production at zero cost **as long as we may list your name/logo as a user**.

### **Q4. What if I‚Äôm a cash-strapped startup?**  
Choose the OEM tier and pay **3 % of future gross SaaS revenue** (invoiced
quarterly) instead of the ‚Ç¨50 000 fixed fee.  That option also includes ten
hours of architectural guidance in Year 1, capped at ‚Ç¨50 000.  This is
designed to help early-stage startups get started without a large upfront
investment, while still supporting the project.

### **Q5. I skipped my renewal last year‚Äîwhat do I pay now?**  
Just the renewal: **25 % of the current one-time price** for your tier.  The new
12-month support window starts on the payment date; skipped months are not
back-billed. You never pay the full licence twice.

### **Q6. Is there any refund if I cancel?**  
No. All fees are **non-refundable** once an invoice is paid, because the full
source is public for prior evaluation.

## ü§ù Support & Community

### **Q7. What is a ‚Äúnamed contact‚Äù?**  
A person authorised to open support tickets in Slack/email.  
* Training/Growth = 1 contact  
* Enterprise = 3 contacts  
* OEM = 5 contacts

### **Q8. How many tickets can we open?**  
Up to **five (5) tickets per calendar month**, pooled across all named contacts.
Response target: P1 ‚â§ 2 business days, P2/P3 ‚â§ 3 business days.

### **Q9. What happens when my support window ends or if the licence is terminated?**

| Situation                                                           | Rights you keep                                                                                      | What you lose                                                          |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Support window expires but no breach** (you simply don‚Äôt renew)   | ‚Ä¢ Perpetual production rights to the last version you paid for<br>‚Ä¢ Non-production evaluation rights | ‚Ä¢ Access to new releases<br>‚Ä¢ Support & SLAs (Service-Level Agreement) |
| **Licence is terminated** (non-payment > 60 days or uncured breach) | ‚Ä¢ Non-production evaluation rights only (‚â§ 25 users)                                                 | ‚Ä¢ All production rights<br>‚Ä¢ Support & SLAs<br>‚Ä¢ No fee refund         |

**One-time fee = pay once, and you can keep running that paid version in production forever**‚Äîprovided you remain in good standing.  Renewals are optional and only affect your access to **new** releases and support.

---

## üí∏ Payments & Upgrades

### **Q10. What does my one-time fee include?**  
Perpetual production rights **plus** 12 months of updates and support.  
After that you can (a) run your current version forever for free, or  
(b) renew support/updates yearly at 25 %.

### **Q11. Can we upgrade tiers later?**  
Yes. Pay the price difference between tiers; your support clock resets to 12 months on the new tier.

### **Q12. How do I request a quote or invoice?**  
Email **alex@doodleops.com** with your legal entity name, billing address,
and desired tier. We‚Äôll send a countersignable PDF and a Net-30 invoice that
can be paid via bank transfer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing

### **Q13. Will my pull request be accepted?**  
We welcome PRs!  All contributors must agree to the DoodleOps CLA, which assigns
joint copyright and grants a patent licence to the maintainer.  See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

### **Q14. Do I keep rights to my contribution?**  
Yes, you retain the right to use your code elsewhere; you simply grant the
maintainer the same rights so DoodleOps can be re-licensed or sold under the
commercial terms.

## üîí Security & Acceptable Use

### **Q15. Who is liable if a vulnerability is found?**  
DoodleOps is provided **‚ÄúAS IS.‚Äù**  The maintainer‚Äôs aggregate liability is
capped at the fees you paid in the preceding 12 months and excludes indirect or
consequential damages (see Section 8 of the Commercial Licence).

### **Q16. Can I use DoodleOps for gambling, porn, or other risky content?**  
No. Such use violates the [Acceptable Use Policy](ACCEPTABLE_USE_POLICY.md).  We 
may suspend or terminate licences for AUP breaches without refund.
