# Acceptance Criteria

- Ticket has a title (short clear description of the task);
- If necessary, the ticket is linked to other related ones;
- Has estimated story points;
- Has acceptance criteria defined (specific to the task);
- Fulfils the INVEST criteria:
  - Independent: User Stories should be written so they can be developed and 
    tested independently of other stories. This allows for greater flexibility in
    the development process and helps to avoid unnecessary dependencies.
  - Negotiable: User Stories should be written to allow for negotiation between 
    the development team and the customer. This helps ensure that the final 
    product meets the customer's needs.
  - Valuable: User Stories should provide value to the end user. This value can be
    in the form of a new feature, an improvement to an existing feature, or a bug 
    fix.
  - Estimable: User Stories should be written in a way that allows the development
    team to estimate the amount of effort required to complete them.
  - Small: User Stories should be small enough to be completed within a single
    iteration of the development process. This helps ensure that the development 
    process remains focused and efficient.
  - Testable: User Stories should be written to allow testing to be performed at 
    the end of the development process. This helps ensure the story is complete 
    and meets the customer's requirements.
