# DoD

**DoD for a Ticket Creation :**

- Person of contact for additional details
- If the ticket is for a bug, instructions and steps how to reproduce the issue 
  will be needed.
- If the ticket is for a functionality, the actual behavior will be needed and 
  expected behavior in details.
- The ticket must have a time limit
 
**DoD for a Ticket Completion :** 

- All the tickets must be properly documented or update the existing one.
- All acceptance criteria are met as defined by the Product Owner.
- The code, if any, is merged in the appropriate branch (Dev, st, prod) and passes
all CI/CD steps.
- The feature, if any, is tested and works (is peer reviewed).  All automated 
tests pass.
- The ticket must be tested and free of defects.
- The ticket must be reviewed and approved by the product owner or other 
stakeholder.
- The scheduled time must be meet.
- The ticket can be presented in the sprint review.
 
**How do we assign story points?**

We use the Fibonacci series:

- 1 point ~ 1/2 day
- 2 points ~ 1 -2 days
- 3 points ~ 2 - 3 days
- 5 points ~ 1 week
- 8 points ~ 1.5 weeks
- 13 points ~ 2 weeks

We should never create stories that are harder than 13 points, they should get 
split into smaller tasks.
