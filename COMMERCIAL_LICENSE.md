# Commercial License for **DoodleOps**

DoodleOps is distributed under the Business Source License 1.1 (see [LICENSE](LICENSE.md)),
which allows unlimited **non-production** use and, for recognised NGOs, free
production use in exchange for logo attribution.

For any other production or revenue-generating use, you must purchase a
Commercial License. This document describes the one-time licence fee, what it
includes, and how renewals for updates & support work.

## 3. Renewal for Updates & Support

* **Optional renewal fee:** 25 % of the *current* one-time price for your tier.  
* Coverage clock:** Each renewal buys you **12 months** of updates & support **starting on the payment date**.  
* **Skip time if you want:** You can let your coverage lapse for any length of time; when you return you still pay only the 25 % renewal—never the full licence again.  Lapsed months are simply uncovered and are **not** back-billed.

### Example:
| Timeline                                           | Coverage status                                             | Payment                      |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Year 1** – purchase Growth tier (€12 000)        | Perpetual production rights + 12 mo updates/support         | **€12 000**                  |
| **Year 2** – no renewal                            | Keep running last Year-1 version; no new patches or support | €0                           |
| **Year 3, Month 5** – decide to get latest release | 12 mo updates/support starting today                        | **25 % × €12 000 = €3 000**  |

> You may run the last version you obtained **forever** without paying again;
> you simply won’t receive newer releases or support until you renew.

## 5. Security & Warranty Disclaimer

The Licensor provides the software **as-is**, with **no warranty**—express or
implied—of security, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.
Because the full source is public, the Licensee must evaluate suitability and
security before deployment.  The Licensor will make **best-effort** to patch
reported vulnerabilities during an active support window but has **no legal
obligation** beyond that.

---

## 6. Purchasing, Payment & Refunds

1. **Quote request:** e-mail `alex@doodleops.com` with legal entity, tier, and billing address.  
2. **Sign agreement:** Licensor e-mails a countersignable PDF referencing this Commercial License.  
3. **Invoice:** Net-30 days, payable by bank transfer or Stripe.  
4. **Delivery:** Non-expiring licence, issued within 1 business day after cleared funds.

**All fees are non-refundable.**  
Because the full source code is publicly available for prior evaluation, the Licensee acknowledges that:  
* (a) payment grants immediate access to production rights, updates, and support; and  
* (b) therefore no right of withdrawal, cancellation, or refund applies once the invoice is paid, except where mandatory consumer-protection law cannot be waived (which does **not** apply to business-to-business transactions).

Fees are in Euro, exclusive of VAT where applicable.

---

## 7. Termination

This Commercial License terminates automatically if:

* **Non-payment:** any invoice is more than 60 days overdue; **or**  
* **Breach:** the Licensee materially breaches the BSL 1.1, AUP or this Commercial License and fails to cure the breach within 30 days of written notice.

Upon termination:

1. **No refund.**  Fees already paid remain non-refundable.  
2. **Cease production use.**  Licensee must stop deploying or operating the Licensed Work in production environments, or purchase a new licence.  
3. **Continued evaluation rights.**  The Licensee may continue to use the Licensed Work under the free, non-production terms of the BSL 1.1 Additional Use Grant.

ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.

RELATING TO THIS COMMERCIAL LICENSE **EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID** BY THE

PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.

THE LICENSOR WILL **NOT** BE LIABLE FOR ANY **INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES**—INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR THE COST OF
PROCURING SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES—HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING

Bucharest.
